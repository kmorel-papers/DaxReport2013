	Abstract = {The most common abstraction used by visualization libraries and applications today is what is known as the visualization pipeline. The visualization pipeline provides a mechanism to encapsulate algorithms and then couple them together in a variety of ways. The visualization pipeline has been in existence for over twenty years, and over this time many variations and improvements have been proposed. This paper provides a literature review of the most prevalent features of visualization pipelines and some of the most recent research directions.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present simple and efficient array-based mesh data structures, including a compact representation of the half-edge data structure for surface meshes, and its generalization --a half-face data structure-- for volume meshes. These array-based structures provide comprehensive and efficient support for querying incidence, adjacency, and boundary classification, but require substantially less memory than pointer-based mesh representations. In addition, they are easy to implement in traditional programming languages (such as in C or Fortran 90) and convenient to exchange across different software packages or different storage media. In a parallel setting, they also support partitioned meshes and hence are particularly appealing for large-scale scientific and engineering applications. We demonstrate the construction and usage of these data structures for various operations, and compare their space and time complexities with alternative structures.},
	Annote = {Describes a cellular data structure (sometimes abbreviated CDS). It is based on the observation that each polyhedron in a linear mesh is itself a manifold polygon mesh. Thus, each polyhedron is represented with a half-edge structure. The global mesh topology is represented by half-faces (also sometimes called half-facets). Each cell has a circular linked list of half-faces. As the name implies, there are two half-faces for each face in the mesh, one for each incident cell. Each half-face points to the next half-face in the cell's list, the half-face for the adjacent cell, and a half edge for the face in the half-edge structure for this cell.},

In the half-edge structure, each edge is represented by two half edges, each associated with one of the two adjacent polygons. A polygon is represented as the cycle of half edges around it. Each half-edge points to the next half edge and the adjacent half edge, which is pointing in the opposite direction.},

@inproceedings{Levy2001,
	Abstract = {We present the Circular Incident Edge Lists (CIEL), a new data structure and a high-performance algorithm for generating a series of iso-surfaces in a highly unstructured grid. Slicing-based volume rendering is also considered. The CIEL data structure represents all the combinatorial information of the grid, making it possible to optimize the classical propagation from local minima paradigm. The usual geometric structures are replaced by a more efficient combinatorial structure. An active edges list is maintained, and iteratively propagated from an iso-surface to the next one in a very efficient way. The intersected cells incident to each active edge are retrieved, and the intersection polygons are generated by circulating around their facets. This latter feature enables arbitrary irregular cells to be treated, such as those encountered in certain computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Since the CIEL data structure solely depends on the connections between the cells, it is possible to take into account dynamic changes in the geometry of the mesh and in property values, which only requires the sorted extrema list to be updated. Experiments have shown that our approach is significantly faster than classical methods. The major drawback of our method is its memory consumption, higher than most classical methods. However, experimental results show that it stays within a practical range.},
	Annote = {Describes circular incident edge lists (CIEL) to represent polyhedral meshes. Circular incident edge lists are represented almost wholly by half edges. Each half-edge belongs to a particular face of a particular cell. Each half-edge has several links to capture the polyhedra topology:

* A link to the next vertex in the face of the cell (equivalent to the adjacent edge link in a half-edge data structure).
* A link to the half edge of the adjacent face in the same cell (equivalent to the adjacent polygon in a half-edge data structure).
* A link to the corresponding half-edge in the adjacent cell along the face (which will be pointing in the opposite direction).
* A linked list of all half-edges attached to a vertex.},

@techreport{PISTON,
	Abstract = {Due to the wide variety of current and next-generation supercomputing architectures, the development of highperformance parallel visualization and analysis operators frequently requires re-writing the underlying algorithms for many different platforms. In order to facilitate portability, we have devised a framework for creating such operators that employs the data-parallel programming model. By writing the operators using only data-parallel primitives (such as scans, transforms, stream compactions, etc.), the same code may be compiled to multiple targets using architecture-specific backend implementations of these primitives. Specifically, we make use of and extend NVIDIA's Thrust library, which provides CUDA and OpenMP backends. Using this framework, we have implemented isosurface, cut surface, and threshold operators, and have achieved good parallel performance on two different architectures (multi-core CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs) using the exact same operator code. We have applied these operators to several large, real scientific data sets, and have open-source released a beta version of our code base.},

@book{Blelloch1990,
	Abstract = {Vector Models for Data-Parallel Computing describes a model of parallelism that extends and formalizes the Data-Parallel model on which the Connection Machine and other supercomputers are based. It presents many algorithms based on the model, ranging from graph algorithms to numerical algorithms, and argues that data-parallel models are not only practical and can be applied to a surprisingly wide variety of problems, they are also well suited for very-high-level languages and lead to a concise and clear description of algorithms and their complexity. Many of the author's ideas have been incorporated into the instruction set and into algorithms currently running on the Connection Machine.

The book includes the definition of a parallel vector machine; an extensive description of the uses of the scan (also called parallel-prefix) operations; the introduction of segmented vector operations; parallel data structures for trees, graphs, and grids; many parallel computational-geometry, graph, numerical and sorting algorithms; techniques for compiling nested parallelism; a compiler for Paralation Lisp; and details on the implementation of the scan operations.},

@inproceedings{Baker2010,
	Abstract = {Multicore nodes have become ubiquitous in just a few years. At the same time, writing portable parallel software for multicore nodes is extremely challenging. Widely available programming models such as OpenMP and Pthreads are not useful for devices such as graphics cards, and more flexible programming models such as RapidMind are only available commercially. OpenCL represents the first truly portable standard, but its availability is limited. In the presence of such transition, we have developed a minimal application programming interface (API) for multicore nodes that allows us to write portable parallel linear algebra software that can use any of the aforementioned programming models and any future standard models. We utilize C++ template meta-programming to enable users to write parallel kernels that can be executed on a variety of node types, including Cell, GPUs and multicore CPUs. The support for a parallel node is provided by implementing a Node object, according to the requirements specified by the API. This ability to provide custom support for particular node types gives developers a level of control not allowed by the current slate of proprietary parallel programming APIs. We demonstrate implementations of the API for a simple vector dot-product on sequential CPU, multicore CPU and GPU nodes.},
